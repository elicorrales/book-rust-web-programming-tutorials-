# Tutorials Inspired by book: Rust Web Programming

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

## [Video: How I Learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTe-8WwR4Xc&list=PLNKa8O7lX-w5OCsqlXnfS-mhrzvyhzU0u&index=1)  
<br/>  

## [Video: Intro To Rust Enums & Structures]()  
In this video we play around with Structs in combination with Enums.  
The code in the video and in repo isn't necessarily recommended, as-is, but is a way to get familiar with the concepts.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/https-github.com-elicorrales-book-rust-web-programming-tutorials-play-1-num-1) is the code.

## [Video: Simple Actix Web Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXoxUNugf7A)  
In this video we create a simple but updated version of a web server from page 17 of the book.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/book-rust-prog-sys-dev-tutorials-play-1-num-3) is the code.
