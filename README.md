# Tutorials Inspired by book: Rust Web Programming

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

## [Video: How I Learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTe-8WwR4Xc&list=PLNKa8O7lX-w5OCsqlXnfS-mhrzvyhzU0u&index=1)  
<br/>  

## [Video: Intro To Rust Enums & Structures - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xqIYsXjBAI&list=PLNKa8O7lX-w6ZW4Y7_CoQc6PEAcXxqLsI&index=4)  
In this video we play around with Structs in combination with Enums.  
The code in the video and in repo isn't necessarily recommended, as-is, but is a way to get familiar with the concepts.  
  
All of the inner workings of our "Locations" object or structure are visible, so it would seem to break "encapsulation" and "abstraction".  
  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/book-rust-web-programming-tutorials-play-1-num-1/blob/main/README.md) is the code.

## [Video: Intro To Rust Enums & Structures - Part 2]()  
In this video we continue with Structs in combination with Enums.  
The code in the video and in repo isn't necessarily recommended, as-is, but is a way to get familiar with the concepts.  
We show why perhaps what we did in Part 1 could be improved by "encapsulation" and "abstraction".    
We move the inner workings over to a library.  
  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/book-rust-web-programming-tutorials-play-1-num-2/blob/main/README.md) is the code.
